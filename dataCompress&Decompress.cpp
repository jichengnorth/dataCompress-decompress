 Code Design Test: Data Compression Design

 Basic design :
 1. For this assignment, I decided to use C++, and without using STLs. I am confident with using STL too.  However, for this task, I think we do not have to use STL, and the position I am applying for, is also more embedded C focus, so this might be a good way to approach this assignment.
 1.this algorithm will compress the same value repeated in the series into 2 integers(value, #number). ex. 1, 1, 1 ==> 1,3
 2. Just to make sure that we don't accidentally expend the data. if it is a unique number, we only print out the value. ex. 1,2,3,3,3 ==> 1,2,3,3
 4. Since in CPP, the array could only hold one type of data and we would like to have a lossless compression, we must distinguish the value and #number. to do so I decided to use the negative sign. However, this method also has a limitation size of 128. If it spills over, we will write -128 and the reminder. ex. 257 0s => 0,-128,-128,-1
 3. There are 3 pointers for the algorithm, i,j, write+p. j start iterating the array, once it meets a different value, write_p will write the data with the value or ( value and #number). I catch up.
 4 The limitation for this algorithm is it will not compress that well if there is not same value repeated in the series for more than 2 times. But it would not large the size of the data.
 5. runtime: O(2n) iterate through the whole array to copy or run the algorithm.
 6. space complexity: O(1) no complex data struct, â€“ constant complexity
 
 
Remarks:
1.  The implementation was only used with the std library, without using STLs. it saves a little bit more space and runtime are a little faster in theory. I personally feel it is a little bit more challenging, so I decided to do it this way.
 
2. However, when executing the algorithm, we are overwriting the array, and the useless space is filled with garbage data, this could potentially lead to code vulnerabilities. Possible ways to fix it: 2. Create a different array just for the compressed data, and return the pointer and the size.

2. If we just pass a pointer of the original data address, and overwrite the value. Technically, we will save the pointer space, and avoid the O(n) for copying the data to the new array. But we will lose the original data.  In this code, we were able to Deallocate Heap memory.

3. This is when stls come in handy because I can easily resize my container class.
